**User Control:**

The user is able to create a one to five word password that is generated randomly. The words are generated by pressing 1,2,3,4 or, 5 on the key board. Once one of those keys are pressed, a word will appear under the number the user pressed. The user is able to change a single word in the password by pressing a certain key. This function will replace a word in the password with a new one that is generated randomly. Another feature in the program is that the user is able to reset the password by pressing "r". After reseting the password, the user can create a new password.

**Sercurity Flaws:**

The user is only able to make a one to five word password, and is unable to make a longer password with more than five words. The user can only make one password, but the user can customize the password by changing a single word in the password without changing the other ones.
