During the rotation 2 project, I created a password generator that can create a one to five word password. Throughout this project, I learned how to generate a random number as a lookupkey to find a word in the database. First, I created a function, generateLookupKey, which generates a random number through a loop. Then I learned how to use a conditional to run this function and place the word on the screen. For example, if a certain key is pressed, a random number will be generated, and then that key will retrieve a word in the database. Next, the word that was selected gets put on an array to be displayed on the screen. I also learned how to use an array to display the words in the password. Initially, there is an empty array, but as a word gets retrieved when a certain button is pressed that word will be added to that spot in the array.
